Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
Example: 
First Pass: 
( 5 1 4 2 8 ) –> ( 1 5 4 2 8 ), Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 5 > 1. 
( 1 5 4 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 5 2 8 ), Swap since 5 > 4 
( 1 4 5 2 8 ) –>  ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Swap since 5 > 2 
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5), algorithm does not swap them.
Second Pass: 
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) 
( 1 4 2 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ), Swap since 4 > 2 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –>  ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
Now, the array is already sorted, but our algorithm does not know if it is completed. The algorithm needs one whole pass without any swap to know it is sorted.
Third Pass: 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) 
( 1 2 4 5 8 ) –> ( 1 2 4 5 8 )

To convert C to CheckedC using 3C --> 
3c -addcr -alltypes -output-postfix=checked bubble_sort.c --

This should generate the checked.c with a <file_name>.checked.c format. 
Now if you intend to compile this, you will need a specialized clang compiler with checkedc 
extension, your typical gcc compiler will not work

//compile your clang compiler by following instruction here 
https://github.com/correctcomputation/checkedc-clang/blob/main/clang/docs/checkedc/Setup-and-Build.md
//later you you can use the executable(clang) directly in the build/bin directory to compile your checked C code.

<Path_to_your_compiled_clang_executable>/clang -O2 -o bb bubble_sort.c
